# Comment on our 3 models:

# DAILY: We used an ARIMA model on the daily hunting data. The daily data was v. noisy and unpredictable, making
# it harder to trust the daily model for interpretation or forecasting.


# WEEKLY: The weekly data provides us with a much better model. The model detects short-term patterns and gives a more structured 
# fit than the daily version. 


# MONTHLY: This model fit to the monthly data is very simple and only includes a constant, which suggests it
# doesn't pick up much structure. Likely because there are too few data points to detect clear trends or patterns.


# for now, we'll stick with the weekly data and proceed...

# The large spike near zero is reduced, and the long right tail is largely gone.
# Still a slight left skew (some very negative residuals), but vastly improved from before.


# Therefore log transforming the data improved things, as Dan suggested. 
# The log1p() transformation:
#   Reduced extreme values and stabilised variance.
#   Helped produce more normally distributed and uncorrelated residuals.

########################################################
# GAM
########################################################


# Why use a GAM here?
# - Generalised Additive Models are a flexible way to model non-linear patterns over time 
#
# - The smooth term for week_in_year can capture complex seasonal patterns in hunting offtake, 
#   while still respecting that weeks wrap around (week 52 connects back to week 1).
#
# - By adding a species-level term, we can account for differences in baseline offtake between species,
#   and, if desired, allow the shape of the seasonal curve itself to vary for each species.
#
# - This makes GAMs ideal for detecting and describing broad seasonal trends, as well as species-specific
#   deviations from those trends.



### GAM with Negative Binomial

# s(week_in_year, bs = "cc") is a smooth that loops thorugh the weeks in the year 1 -> 52 like a circle.
# s(species, bs = "re") gives each species its own baseline level.

gam_seasonal <- gam(
  total ~ s(week_in_year, bs = "cc", k = 10) + s(species, bs = "re"),
  data   = species_week,
  family = nb(),
  knots  = list(week_in_year = c(0.5, 52.5))
)

# Lets check how this model performed
summary(gam_seasonal)
plot(gam_seasonal, pages = 1, shade = TRUE)


# Understanding results of "gam_seasonal":
# - The seasonal smooth is strong: s(week_in_year) has edf â‰ˆ 4.1 and p = 0.003. 
#   That means a clear, non-linear within-year cycle in offtake rather than a flat or simple linear trend.
#
# - There is big species-level heterogeneity: s(species) is highly significant (p < 2e-16), 
#   so species differ a lot in their baseline offtake.
#
# - The intercept is 1.313 on the log scale, i.e. an average weekly offtake of about exp(1.313) â‰ˆ 3.7 individuals for a 
#   species with an average baseline.
# 
# - Fit summaries (Adj. RÂ² â‰ˆ 0.51, Deviance explained â‰ˆ 87%) suggest the model captures most of the structure. 


# Tweak to the GAM: allow for species-specific deviations in the seasonal pattern
gam_species_fs <- gam(
  total ~ s(week_in_year, bs = "cc", k = 10) +
    s(week_in_year, species, bs = "fs", k = 5, m = 1),
  data   = species_week,
  family = nb(),
  knots  = list(week_in_year = c(0.5, 52.5))

summary(gam_species_fs)
plot(gam_species_fs, pages = 1, shade = TRUE)


# compare AIC vals of the two models
AIC(gam_seasonal)
AIC(gam_species_fs)



# Understanding results of "gam_species_fs":
# - Strong overall seasonal pattern remains: s(week_in_year) edf ~ 3.48, p < 0.001 â†’ general hunting seasonality.
# - Species-specific curves: s(week_in_year, species) edf ~ 33, p < 2e-16 â†’ species differ in timing/strength of seasonal peaks.
# - Model fit marginally improves compared to simple seasonal model: Adj. R^2 ~ 0.572 (vs 0.511 in simpler GAM), deviance explained ~ 88.6% (vs 87%).
# - Interpretation: The seasonal pattern varies slightly by species â€” this extra complexity slightly improves model fit.

########################################################
# GLMM
########################################################


# Lastly, with the offtake_df, let's try a GLMM. 
# GLMMs are useful here because they let us model overall time trends while accounting 
# for repeated measurements within species (pseudoreplication), avoiding inflated significance.



# 1) Random-intercept model: each species has its own baseline level
glmm_ns <- glmmTMB::glmmTMB(
  total ~ splines::ns(week_index, df = 5) + (1 | species),
  data   = species_week,
  family = glmmTMB::nbinom2()
)

summary(glmm_ns)
DHARMa::simulateResiduals(glmm_ns) |> plot()

# 2) Random-slopes model: allows species to have different time trends
glmm_rs <- glmmTMB::glmmTMB(
  total ~ splines::ns(week_index, df = 5) + (week_index | species),
  data   = species_week,
  family = glmmTMB::nbinom2()
)

summary(glmm_rs)
DHARMa::simulateResiduals(glmm_rs) |> plot()

# Compare models using AIC (lower is better)
AIC(glmm_ns, glmm_rs)


# Interpretation:
#   
# Random-intercept model (glmm_ns): AIC = 2038.6
# Random-slope model (glmm_rs): AIC = 2041.4
# 
# - Since the AIC is slightly lower for the random-intercept model, adding species-specific time trends (random slopes) 
#   doesnâ€™t improve the fit enough to justify the extra complexity.
# 
# - The significant spline terms (ns(week_index, df = 5)2 and ns(week_index, df = 5)4) mean there are non-linear time patterns 
#   in offtake, but theyâ€™re consistent enough across species that a single smooth for all species is adequate.
# 
# - The very small variance for the random slope (week_index = 0.0025) confirms what the GAM per species plot shows above, that 
#   thereâ€™s minimal variation between species in how offtake changes over time.
